/*
Static memory is memory that is reserved for variables before the program runs.
Allocation of static memory is also known as compile time memory allocation.

Dynamic memory is memory that is allocated after the program starts running.
Allocation of dynamic memory can also be referred to as runtime memory allocation.

Dynamic memory does not belong to a variable, it can only be accessed with pointers.
