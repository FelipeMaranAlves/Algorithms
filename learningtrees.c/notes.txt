depth   ->depth of a vertex v is the length of the simple path from the root to v
height is the longest path from the root to a leaf

Ordered Trees An ordered tree is a rooted tree in which all the children of each
vertex are ordered.

A binary tree can be defined as an ordered tree in which every vertex has
no more than two children and each child is designated as either a left child or a
right child of its parent -> recursão

    E value
    struct node* right child (will be the one whose value is greater than this node's value)
    struct node* left child  (will be the one whose value is smaller than this node's value)
